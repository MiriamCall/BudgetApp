# Overview

I created a budgeting app that runs in the terminal. This program helps the user keep track of how much they earned, spent, and what those were for. 

The purpose in writting this software was to help increase my understanding of C# and how it works. I was able to understand classes better and how they connect to the main function.

# Development Environment

For developing the software I used RiderDB. This code editor is set up well for writting in C# and has a lot of libraries in it specifically for C#.

The language I wrote this program in was C#.

# Future Work

- Add more features to increase accuracy of income and outcome
- Create a place they can add money specifically to savings or something that are saving for
